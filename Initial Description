This project is a simplified front-end clone of the Amazon e-commerce website, built using HTML and CSS.
It replicates the basic layout and design of Amazon's homepage, focusing on user interface elements.
The goal is to demonstrate proficiency in structuring web pages with HTML and styling them using CSS, including flexbox, grids and many more. 
The project is hosted on GitHub as part of my portfolio to showcase my front-end development skills. 
Contributions and feedback are welcome ...
